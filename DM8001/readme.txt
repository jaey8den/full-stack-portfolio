Overview:
The idea behind this submission is to create a website for myself 
where I can post interesting writeups to showcase my writing skills. The
posts mainly fall into three topics, Food, Shower Thoughts, and Note to Self.
As I aspire to be a copywriter in the future, a blog of my own will act as a
portfolio.

Shortcomings:
1. For the case of this submission, I only have 3 posts as I find it 
redundant to replicate multiple articles with dummy text.

2. You will find that the hover menu under 'blogs' will have no links to them. 
This has the same reason as the first point. Ideally, clicking on 'blogs' and
'See all >' should bring the user to a lists of all the posts. Clicking on
either of the categories will show the articles listed in that category.

3. This project is done on my 13 inch laptop and may not be compatible with
larger screens. Content is made to be as responsive as possible.

4. There is a lot of room for improvement in terms of aethetics and content,
but it will have to do.
